      <description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>

      <description>I am a PhD candidate in Transportation Engineering at the Federal University of Ceará (UFC) and research assistant at the Institute for Applied Economic Research (IPEA). In short: I am passionate about cities and data.
IPEA At Ipea I am part of the Access to Opportunities team. The project, created by my friend/boss Rafael Pereira at the beginning of 2019, has as main objective to calculate indicators of urban accessibility for the biggest Brazilian cities, aiming to subsidize researchers and public policy makers.</description>
